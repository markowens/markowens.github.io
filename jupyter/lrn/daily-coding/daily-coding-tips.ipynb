    "</p>\n",

    "*    First, go through an example. This buys time, makes sure you understand the problem, and \n",
    "lets you gain some intuition for the problem. For example, if we had:\n",

    "*    Next, give any solution you can think of (even if it's brute force). It seems obvious that if we just flattened the lists and sorted it, we would get the answer we want. The time complexity for that would be <code>O(KN log KN)</code>, since we have <code>K * N</code> total elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    The third step is to think of pseudocode—a high-level solution for the problem. This is where we explore different solutions. The things we are looking for are better space/time complexities but also the difficulty of the implementation. You should be able to finish the solution in 30 minutes. Here, we can see that we only need to look at K elements in each of the lists to find the smallest element initially. Heaps are great for finding the smallest element. Let's say the smallest element is E. Once we get E, we know we're interested in only the next element of the list that held E. Then we'd extract out the second smallest element and etc. The time complexity for this would be O(KN log K), since we remove and append to the heap K * N times.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    Initialize the heap. In Python this this is just a list. We need K tuples. One for the index for which list among the list of lists the element lives; one for the element index which is where the element lives; and the value of the element. Since we want the key of the heap to be based on the value of the element, we should put that first in the tuple.\n",

    "## Backtracking Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Today I'd like to give you some tips on how to solve backtracking questions. Backtracking is an effective technique for solving algorithmic problems. In backtracking, we search depth-first for solutions, backtracking to the last valid path as soon as we hit a dead end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking reduces the search space since we no longer have to follow down any paths we know are invalid. This is called pruning. We must be able to test partial solutions: for example, we can't find a global optimum using backtracking, since we have no idea if the solution we're currently on can lead to it or not. But we can, for example, solve Sudoku using backtracking. We can know immediately if our solution so far is invalid by testing if two of the same number appear in the same row, column, or square.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through several examples of problems that can be nicely solved with backtracking to drill this concept down.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The N queens puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "The N queens puzzle is the classic backtracking problem. The question is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "You have an N by N board. Write a function that returns the number of possible arrangements of the board where N queens can be placed on the board without threatening each other, i.e. no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing, you should take some time to try to solve it on your own!\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, let's describe the brute force solution to this problem, which means trying every single combination of N queens in each of N * N spots. That's n2 choose n, which is painfully slow. We can immediately improve the runtime of this algorithm by noticing that there's no point in ever placing two queens on the same row (or column), so we really only need to have one queen per row. Now, using brute force, we need to iterate over each row and over each spot on each row. Since we have N rows and N columns, our runtime will be O(NN). That's still hella slow, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's helpful to ask ourselves three questions to determine whether we can apply backtracking to a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Can we construct a partial solution?</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we can tentatively place queens on the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Can we verify if the partial solution is invalid?</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we can check a solution is invalid if two queens threaten each other. To speed this up, we can assume that all queens already placed so far do not threaten each other, so we only need to check if the last queen we added attacks any other queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Can we verify if the solution is complete?</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we know a solution is complete if all N queens have been placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are confident that we can use backtracking, let's apply it to this problem. We'll loop through the first row and try placing a queen in column 0..N, and then the second, and so on up until N. What differs here from brute force is that we'll be adding the queens incrementally instead of all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create an <code>is_valid</code> function that will check the board on each incremental addition. <code>is_valid</code> will look at the last queen placed and see if any other queen can threaten it. If so, then we prune the branch since there's no point pursuing it. Otherwise, we'll recursively call ourselves with the new incremental solution. We only stop once we hit the base case: we've placed all queens on the board already.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent our board as just a 1D array of integers from 1..N, where the value at the index i that represents the column the queen on row i is on. Since we're working incrementally, we don't even need to have the whole board initialized. We can just append and pop as we go down the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the actual code in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "def n_queens(n, board=[]):\n",
    "    if n == len(board):\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    for col in range(n):\n",
    "        board.append(col)\n",
    "        if is_valid(board):\n",
    "            count += n_queens(n, board)\n",

    "    for row, col in enumerate(board[:-1]):\n",
    "        diff = abs(current_queen_col - col)\n",

    "#### 2. Flight itinerary problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The flight itinerary problem is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an unordered list of flights taken by someone, each represented as (origin, destination) pairs, and a starting airport, compute the person's itinerary. If no such itinerary exists, return null. All flights must be used in the itinerary.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "and starting airport YUL, you should return YUL ➔ ORD ➔ SFO ➔ HNL ➔ AKL. (This also happens to be the actual itinerary for the trip I'm about to take.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should take some time to try to solve it on your own! Notice that a greedy solution won't work, since it's possible to have a cycle in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's again describe the brute force solution to this problem, which is to try every permutation of flights and verify that it's a valid itinerary. That would be O(n!). Now let's ask ourselves if we can improve this with backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Can we construct a partial solution?</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we can build an (incomplete) itinerary and extend it by adding more flights to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Can we verify if the partial solution is invalid?</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we can check a solution is invalid if 1) there are no flights leaving from our last destination and 2) there are still flights remaining that can be taken. Since we must use all flights, this means we're at a dead end.\n",
    "Can we verify if the solution is complete?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we can check if a solution is complete if our itinerary uses all the flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use this to construct our solution:\n",

    "Instead, let's attempt to solve using loop invariants. On the ith iteration of our loop to pick a random element, let's assume we already picked an element uniformly from [0, i - 1]. In order to maintain the loop invariant, we would need to pick the ith element as the new random element at 1 / (i + 1) chance. For the base case where i = 0, let's say the random element is the first one. Then we know it works because\n",

    "Today I'd like to give you some tips on how to solve tree-based interview questions. Tree questions are very common at top tech company interviews. I had two tree questions in my Google onsite interviews and one during my Facebook onsite interviews. An awesome thing about them is that they can be formulaically solved every single time. It doesn’t involve any genius insight. Let me show you how.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of being too abstract, let’s just dive right into an easy binary tree question. Then I’ll walk through how to solve it and we can go into a harder problem after:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Given the root to a binary tree, count the total number of nodes there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on further, feel free to take a moment to think about the answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving any binary tree question involves just two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "First is solving the base case. This usually means solving the leaf node case (a leaf node has no left or right children) or the null case. For the above problem, we can see that a null should represent 0 nodes while a leaf node should represent 1 node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second is the recursive step. Assuming you knew the solution to the left subtree and the right subtree, how could you combine the two results to give you the final solution? It’s important to not get caught up on how this works and just have faith that it works. If you start tracing the recursion, you’re going to needlessly use up time and energy during the interview. Intuitively though, it works for similar reasons as why regular induction works. P(0) or the base case works which causes P(1) or the leaf node to work which causes P(2) to work and so on. For this problem, it’s easy to combine the results of the left and right subtrees. Just add the two numbers and then another 1 for the root. Here’s the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "def count(node):\n",

    "<blockquote>\n",
    "    Given the root to a binary tree, return the deepest node.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Base case for this question actually can’t be null, because it’s not a real result that can be combined (null is not a node). Here we should use the leaf node as the base case and return itself.\n",
