- So, this is my Unix shell
and as you see my username is altintas,
and I'm in the /Users/altintas directory
which happens to be my home directory.
When I say ls under this directory,
I'll see that I have a directory
called Python for Data Science.
Why did ls work?
Ls is a Unix command
and it stands for list.
It lists the files and folders
in any Unix directory.
So, I would like to switch
the working directory I am in,
to Python for Data Science.
So, I'll say change directory.
Cd Python for Data Science.
Yet another Unix command.
Now we'll see that the directory I'm in
changed from /Users/altintas
to /Users/altintas/Python for Data Science.
So, if I say ls here
to list the files and folders under this directory,
I'll see two
text files,
one says fruits.txt,
the other one says shakespeare.txt.
Let's clear this.
We'll make use of another Unix command called clear,
so we could see better.
So, now
let's say
I'm in this working directory
and I want to explore with it
but I forgot what this working directory is.
In my case, you see it clearly
because I made my command line
to show you which working directory we are in
but we can take use of another Unix command,
print working directory, as I mentioned in the video,
the pwd to see what working directory
we are under at the moment.
So, there are two text files in this directory
as you remember.
One Unix command to show the contents of these text files
is called cat.
When I actually say cat,
fruits.txt,
I'll see
the contents of fruits.txt.
I could have done the same for Shakespeare
which is a larger file.
It's gonna go for a while.
It has many lines.
12,000 and something lines that file
but you see that it was still possible
to display the contents with cat.
Let's clear this.
So, how do I know about how to use these Unix commands?
There's a Unix utility or command.
These are exchangeably used utility or command,
they are called utility commands for long.
I can use
the man command, M-A-N,
to stand for manual pages
to look up
the documentation
of any of these commands.
So, I can have man ls,
man cat.
Another thing is ls
actually provides me
with a set of switch options.
So, I can switch ls to display
everything in this directory in long form.
If I display the files and folders in long form,
I'll see here there are two files,
who created them, at what time,
how big those files are,
and access
rights to those files.
I can also
say ls minus a
which will show me the hidden files and folders
in this directory.
So, we see that in addition to those two text files,
I have dot,
that refers to this working directory,
and dot, dot that refers to the directory above.
As you know,
our directory above, Python for Data Science,
is altintas here, which happens to be my home directory.
How do I reach anything under the home directory?
I can definitely say ls
/Users/altintas.
I can say ls
tilde, which is my home directory,
or I can say, now pay attention
how I'm using the dot dot option,
ls dot dot,
which is our parent directory.
I see that
there other files and folders
under this home directory
and if I wanted to reach any of those,
I could have just said ls dot dot slash,
let's say temp
or ls dot dot /CSE15L-1
and things like that.
So, let's clear this
and move on to our next video.
