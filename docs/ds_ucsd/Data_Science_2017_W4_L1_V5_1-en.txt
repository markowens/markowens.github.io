- Now we will review the plotting functions in pandas.
Note that we will come back to more advanced plotting,
in pandas, over the next couple of weeks,
after our in-depth data visualization lesson.
So this is only a simple introduction.
By the end of this video you should be able to identify
key plotting functions of pandas,
and recognize the ease of utilization
of native pandas methods with data frames.
Let us use this data frame as an example to provide
for many plot functions of data frames in this video.
The plot package offers nice visualizations of bar charts,
where each column is represented by a different color,
and turned into a bar that goes until
the value in that column.
Another plot option, box plots,
generated by the box function,
is a good way of showing data distribution.
So each box will have minimum and maximum,
and medium for columns, if you look at this graph.
Histograms, another type of graph,
show the distribution of data, and it can show skewness,
or unusual dispersion between data values.
Via proper use of the hist function, H-I-S-T,
we can generate histograms, not just for one column,
but multiple variables in the data,
just like we see in this graph.
Additionally using the plot function we can create
quick line graphs of our data sets.
Here we see each column in our data frame
represented by a different line,
and those points connected by straight lines.
In summary, pandas provides a diverse set
of colorable methods for plotting.
And they're gonna come a lot on our example notebooks,
as we go through this class.
It's fun to explore these plots and visually look at
your data in different forms.
Sometimes you will start seeing things
that you don't normally see in the data set,
by looking at the data.
Then you visualize that you'll be able to see a lot more.
So we recommend following the link here,
and spending some more time on these functions,
and exploring and having fun with these plots.
