- We have now reached the end of our data science process
description, over the next nine weeks we will use Python
and Jupiter Notebooks to apply this process to case studies
while we learn about critical Python libraries,
that can be used within a data science project.
At the end of the ten weeks, you can be sure that you will
be able to add these skills to your resume.
Hope you have as much fun with Python,
and data science, as we do.
