- In this video, we'll be talking
about the scoping rules in Python.
By the end of this video, you should
be able to understand the scope of a variable
and be able to create a global variable.
We're using an absolute value function from before.
What do you think will happen with this print statement?
Yep, this will cause an error.
And this should be familiar to those
of you with experience in C, C++, or Java.
The variable val was declared in the scope
of the function my_abs.
It doesn't live outside of that.
Now what happens after declaring val
at the start of a code?
Well this code runs just fine.
By declaring val the top of the file
we've made it a global variable.
Be cautious though.
You never wanna have a global variable
have a same name as a function parameter.
We could fix this by naming the global variable differently.
Having "my" denote a global would help
to reduce this problem.
But realize that some company style guidelines,
for example, Google's style guidelines,
do not recommend using global variables at all.
So we've actually wrapped up all the basics
in Python pretty quickly.
You know how to create variables,
deal with dynamic typing, write loops,
write conditionals, and write functions.
So we'll do a quick quiz to check your understanding
and then move onto some common data structures in Python.
