- We will now continue from where we left last video
by working with yet another cell type
called markdown cells.
Let's open a new cell and this time
we will use the plus tool bar button.
Here I push plus and I'll see a new
cell being inserted right below the cell
that was highlighted.
We can now click on the cell
and change the purpose of the cell
from cell to a markdown by choosing markdown
from the dropdown menu on the upper right corner
of this notebook.
So if we go here,
push, click on this code markdown
and instead of code we pick markdown.
So now this cell when I click on it
it's a markdown cell
and it means we can write text in it
instead of code.
This is great for documenting your data analysis pipeline.
I can just say hi and run this,
and I'll see there's a text there.
So I can actually go in that cell again,
on the text, and click on it.
And get back to that markdown cell mode.
Although markdown cell is a simple text markup
designed with simplicity, like a Word editor,
you can do quite a bit of formatting and beautification
as well as scientific editing using these markdown cells.
The markdown cells have support for HTML
and other text formatting languages like LaTeX
if you heard of that.
For example, we can create bullet lists.
When we actually say here,
instead of hi, but actually do it a little nicer.
And then I'll go to the next line
and I'll say star,
space.
Everything I put after this bar space is rendered
into a bulleted list.
So I can say
one fish,
two fish,
red fish,
blue fish
to quote Dr. Seuss.
This, when I run this, and I say Shift + Enter
it's going to create what I just typed
into a bulleted list.
So we can, instead of running code,
we are now rendering HTML
through this text markup cell.
You can make many things with it, alright?
We could also create, for example, titles or headings
for that we will use
the hashtag symbol.
So if we say hashtag, it already shows you
this is heading one,
this is a
markdown cell.
And
here
if you say two hashtags,
it's gonna make it a little smaller,
so it's like a heading two in Word.
It would be
this is heading two.
And if we go on and on like that
three of them, we'll be putting three and onwards.
So when I say Shift + Enter now
I'll see these being rendered as I wanted
which is title, headings, bullet lists and text.
So we can also do a bold text, boldface text,
so I'll just say star star example text here
and if I say Shift + Enter,
it's gonna format it as bold.
I can make things italics or emphasize things
by using an italic font.
I can say example text here.
It already started editing it as italics, or italics.
And I see that it's emphasized, that last line.
Links like google.com, how do we do that?
If you actually just put in http
google.com here, it's going to already render it
as an automatic link to google.com.
So there are so many ways to render text of course,
and if you'd like to learn more,
there's a markdown guide we give you in a follow-up reading.
Also, as a side note, most think of markdowns
as code commenting or documenting your code,
but I think of it more like writing a scientific paper
or a white paper.
You can create very sophisticated editing with markdowns.
For example, you can create equations using LaTeX equations.
LateX is a document editing language,
which has a syntax for many text components
for scientific writing, including writing
equations.
So let's go to that next cell
and maybe here I can show you,
I'll switch that again from that code cell
to a markdown cell like this,
And I'll enter there, a LaTeX equation.
So to write an equation in LaTex,
I need to write them between two dollar symbols
just like this.
And there I can just
write my LaTeX equation,
which will, then we'll see how it gets rendered
into
an equation, nicely formatted.
Okay, let's render this line.
As you see, in the cell, we entered a nice little LaTeX
equation code, even if it's markdown cell,
it's not code cell, it knows how to render that
into this beautiful equation.
So here I can add more text, right?
This is a bold
LaTeX
equation,
and I can enter it now when I say Shift + Enter
I'll see that it's nicely formatted,
almost like you would see in a scientific paper.
This is great when, for example, you're implementing code
from a scientific paper or a data science algorithm
that you'd like to try out.
There's a lot of math involved in there.
You can of course first write an elegant equation in LateX.
Easier to read for humans.
Then you can implement that in a Python function,
in a code cell right after that.
It makes it a little easier to understand
for your collaborators or readers.
Next, we'll talk about how to use code cells
for imaging
in a notebook.
