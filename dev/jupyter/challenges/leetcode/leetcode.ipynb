    "Let us try to build the biggest XOR number binary digit by digit. So, the first question we are going to ask, is there two numbers, such that its XOR starts with 1...... (length is 32 bits). Howe we can find it? Let us use the idea of Problem 1: TwoSum: put all prefixes of lengh one to set and then try to find two numbers in this set such that their XOR starts with 1 (at first we have at most 2 elements in our set). Imagine that there are two numbers, which XOR starts with 1......, then the next question is there are two numbers with XOR starts with 11....., we again iterate through all numbers and find two of them with XOR starts with 11. It can happen that on the next step we did not find XOR starts with 111....., then we do not change our ans and on next step we are looking for XOR starts with 1101... and so on. So:\n",

    "    Create set of all possible starts of numbers, using num & mask: on the first iterations it will be first digit, on the next one first two digits and so on.\n",
